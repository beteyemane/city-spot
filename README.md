## Project Summary

City Spot is a web application where users can sign up and post images from their travels. The users can navigate to the city they visited to share their adventures with other travellers.

# Users Journey

When the user first visits City Spot, they have two paths to reach their desired city: the search bar where they can search for a city, or the links that takes them to each continent where they can select a city.

Once on a city's page, users can view information about that city, posts made by other users and a link to view event and restaurant recommendations.

Users can also like and comment on the posts made by other users. Posts with high amounts of likes will be added to the popular posts page and will be able to like the posts they see on that page.

If a user would like to add a post they will have to register and login, and if the user has forgotten their password they can request an email with the link to change their password.

The user has a profile page which contains their uploaded profile image, bio, a cover photo and their posts. They are also able to edit their bio and cover photo image.

## Process

We first began by wireframing each endpoint which helped us clearly established the routes needed.

# Backend setup

The started on the backend by creating three models: City, Continent, and User.

-routes
-error handling
-testing
-register and login
-external API requests

# Frontend setup

-setting up components and pages
-setting up forms
-connecting API requests to the front end.

# Styling

-semantic UI
-CSS

# Features
